### **🛠️ How to Use the Repository**

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LilithMnatsakanyan/Algorithms_1.git
   cd Algorithms_1
   ```

2. **Run the script** for the specific algorithm you want to test (e.g., `insertion_sort.py` or `quick_sort.py`):
   ```bash
   python insertion_sort.py
   ```

Each algorithm is implemented in **Python**. You can modify the input data to test them with different datasets and explore the performance of each algorithm with varying input sizes. It’s a great way to experiment and deepen your understanding of algorithmic concepts!
